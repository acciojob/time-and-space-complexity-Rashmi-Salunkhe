    <h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <!-- First Paragraph -->
    <p>
        Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science that helps determine how efficient an algorithm is in terms of the time it takes to run. An efficient algorithm is one that performs the desired task in the least amount of time possible, given the input size.
    </p>

    <!-- Second Paragraph -->
    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the input size. It is usually expressed in Big O notation, such as O(n), where n represents the size of the input. Understanding Space Complexity is important for optimizing the memory usage of algorithms.
